You can install Backblaze silently from the command line by running the `bzinstall_mate` utility within the `Backblaze Installer.app`.

### Prerequisite Steps:

- Sign in to your group adminâ€™s Backblaze account.
- Create a Backblaze group (or find an existing group).
- From the Invite & Approve page for that group, click on the "Advanced Deployment Instructions" button
  - Locate the `groupID` and `groupToken` for that group.

### Command to Execute on Each Mac:

```bash
/Volumes/Backblaze\ Installer/Backblaze\ Installer.app/Contents/MacOS/bzinstall_mate -nogui -createaccount <user@corp.com> <password> <groupID> <groupToken>
```

The `none` value can be passed in for the password parameter, so an automatically generated password will be used and the user can request a password reset on the Backblaze website, e.g.,

```bash
/Volumes/Backblaze\ Installer/Backblaze\ Installer.app/Contents/MacOS/bzinstall_mate -nogui -createaccount jsmith@acme.com none 19347619 974g9q7gtq9tgq0gg
```
