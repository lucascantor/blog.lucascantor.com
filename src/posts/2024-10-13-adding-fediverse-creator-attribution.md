Mastodon recently [added a feature](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/07/highlighting-journalism-on-mastodon/) to add author attribution labels to links posted across Mastodon.

When a link to a web page you've created is posted on Mastodon, you can opt to have your own Mastodon account tagged automatically.

You can [see how I've implemented this feature in my own blog here](https://github.com/lucascantor/blog.lucascantor.com/pull/91), in the same pull request I'm using to author this post.

See [Robb Knight's excellent write-up](https://rknight.me/blog/setting-up-mastodon-author-tags/) for for more impmentation details.
