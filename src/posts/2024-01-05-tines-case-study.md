I'm excited to announce that [Tines has published a case study](https://www.tines.com/case-studies/intercom) based on my recent work deploying it as a business process automation platform for IT, InfoSec, and the entire company at Intercom! ðŸŽ‰

You can also find an [example story I've published](https://www.tines.com/library/stories/1213236/handle-malware-alerts-with-crowdstrike-oomnitza-github-and-pagerduty) in the Tines library, showcasing how we automate triage of malware alerts with CrowdStrike, Oomnitza, GitHub, and PagerDuty.

Blake Coolidge has [published an in-depth video on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/blakecoolidge_learn-how-intercom-is-automating-use-cases-activity-7149021756932947969-sWy7/) as well, detailing our overall implementation and how we use Tines at Intercom.
